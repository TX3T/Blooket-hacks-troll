This is a troll you can do on your friends. Say it is new blooket hacks then give them it. Then you can put them in a loop of "Get Trolled"
javascript:const response = confirm("Press ok to verify your a human");

if (response) {
    window.alert("Get trolled");
for (var i = 0; i < Infinity; i++) {
 window.alert("get trolled (Everything after this is a loop)");
}
    console.log("Ok was pressed");
} else {
for (var i = 0; i < Infinity; i++) {
 window.alert("You thought you could get out of this. Your in a loop now");
}
 
    console.log("Cancel was pressed");
}
